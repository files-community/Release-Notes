**Changes in v3.0**

### Design updates
When we set out to update the design, we wanted to ensure users would feel at home with the app they love. We were careful not to move the options and commands users are familiar with, whilst modernizing and refreshing core parts of the UI.

- With v3 being one of the larger releases to date, we decided it was a good time to refresh the logo. After exploring a number of ideas and color combinations, we asked the community to help choose a color. It's probably no surprise, but the community overwhelmingly opted in favor of the familiar yellow color. We also updated the icons for the developer and preview versions of Files (purple & blue) to make it easier to identify the different variants of the app.
- We redesigned the sidebar from the ground up, removing the icons from headers and the indentations from child items. We also added icons to highlight pinned folders.
- We rounded the corners on the file area and adjusted the background opacity to provide more distinction between the sidebar.

### Improved experience for file operations
You can now track the progress and speed of file operations in the Status Center with the new graph feature.

### Rich previews for your Office documents
In addition to support for previewing Office documents, we added support for previewing file formats with a registered shell preview handler.

### Added a Command Palette
We're excited to introduce a Command Palette that lets you search and execute commands quickly and easily. You can access the Command Palette by pressing `ctrl` + `shift` + `p` on your keyboard, or by typing `>` into the address bar. The Command Palette will show you a list of available commands, or you can type in your own query to find the command you need.

### Keep Files in the background
We added an option to keep Files open in the background when closing the last window. This option is designed to improve the startup performance but can be turned on/off from the advanced settings page. Please be advised the using this option will use system resources even when the app is in the background.
