### Added a setting to hide the System Tray icon

You can now hide the System Tray icon through a new option in the Advanced settings page.

### Focus existing tab when opening locations from external process

When opening a location from an external process, Files will now switch to the existing tab if the location is already open, instead of creating a duplicate tab.

### View navigation history 

The back and forward toolbar buttons now display a history flyout when right-clicked. On a touchscreen, you can press and hold for a few seconds to display the menu.

### Added thumbnails to the breadcrumb flyouts

We've enhanced the breadcrumb flyouts with folder thumbnails, offering better visual navigation and context.

### Optional toolbar button to navigate home

We've introduced an optional home button in the toolbar. This feature can be enabled from the Appearance settings page.

### Customize CPU threads when creating archives

You can now choose the number of CPU threads used when creating archives. This feature allows you to optimize performance and manage system resources more effectively.

### Added an action to navigate home

You can now assign a keyboard shortcut to navigate home. This enhancement provides a quick and convenient way to open the home page.

### Experimental support for flattening folders

This feature allows you to transfer all files from nested folders into the root directory, simplifying your file tree and making file management more efficient. You can enable this option under the Experimental section in Settings > Advanced.
